Description
All programs that you wrote until now were executed in text mode on your terminal. Now, let’s discover something more exciting: how to open a graphics window and draw inside? To start your journey in graphic programming, FdF offers to represent “iron wire” meshing in 3D.

bug:
- the mandortary and bonus part are done all together, so no extra bonus rule
- numblock is used for some commands, so there is a problem if no numblock on the computer
- Makefile has a small bug
